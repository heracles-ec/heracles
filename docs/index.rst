This is *Heracles*, a code for harmonic-space statistics on the sphere.
*Heracles* can take catalogues of positions a function values on the sphere and
turn them into wonderful things like angular power spectra and mixing matrices.

*Heracles* is both a Python library, to be used in notebooks or data processing
pipelines, and a tool for running measurements from the command line using a
configuration file.  To jump right in, see :doc:`/getting-started`,
:doc:`api/index`, and :doc:`/cli/index`.
