Installation
============

Requirements
------------

*Heracles* is auto tested on Python versions 3.8 - 3.12.  For now there is no official release so we recommend developer installation only.


Developer installation
----------------------

If you want to install *Heracles* for local development, clone the repository and
install the package in editable mode::

    $ pip install -e .

This will automatically add Heracles modules to your python path so that you can import into you Python codes.
